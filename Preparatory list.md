## **🗺️ C Programming Learning Roadmap**  

### **📌 Phase 1: Fundamentals (Beginner Level)**
🔹 **Getting Started with C**  
✅ Understanding Compilation and Execution  
✅ Setting up a Compiler (GCC, Turbo C, CodeBlocks)  
✅ Writing and Running Your First C Program (`Hello, World!`)  

🔹 **Basic Syntax & Data Types**  
✅ Variables and Constants (`int`, `float`, `char`, `double`)  
✅ Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`, `==`, `!=`)  
✅ Input & Output (`printf()`, `scanf()`)  

🔹 **Control Flow**  
✅ Conditional Statements (`if`, `if-else`, `switch-case`)  
✅ Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
✅ Break and Continue Statements  

---

### **📌 Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts**  
🔹 **Functions & Modular Programming**  
✅ Function Declaration, Definition, and Call  
✅ Passing Arguments (`Call by Value` vs `Call by Reference`)  
✅ Recursion  

🔹 **Arrays & Strings**  
✅ Single and Multi-dimensional Arrays  
✅ String Handling Functions (`strlen()`, `strcpy()`, `strcmp()`)  
✅ Pointers and Arrays  

🔹 **Pointers & Memory Management**  
✅ Pointer Basics (`*`, `&`, `->`)  
✅ Pointer Arithmetic  
✅ Dynamic Memory Allocation (`malloc()`, `calloc()`, `free()`)  

---

### **📌 Phase 3: Advanced Topics**  
🔹 **Structures & Unions**  
✅ Defining and Using Structures (`struct`)  
✅ Nested Structures  
✅ Difference Between Structures and Unions  

🔹 **File Handling**  
✅ Reading/Writing Files (`fopen()`, `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`, `fclose()`)  
✅ File Modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `rb`, `wb`)  

🔹 **Data Structures in C**  
✅ Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
✅ Stacks & Queues (Array and Linked List Implementation)  
✅ Trees & Graphs (Basic Implementation)  

---

### **📌 Phase 4: Practical Projects & Problem Solving**  
🔹 **Project Ideas**  
✅ Simple Calculator  
✅ Student Record System (Using Files & Structures)  
✅ Snake Game (Using 2D Arrays & Graphics)  
✅ Bank Management System  

🔹 **Competitive Coding & Challenges**  
✅ Solve problems on **HackerRank, CodeChef, LeetCode**  
✅ Implement Sorting & Searching Algorithms  

---

### **📌 Phase 5: Mastering C & Exploring Applications**  
🔹 **System Programming with C**  
✅ Working with OS-Level Functions  
✅ Multi-threading & Concurrency (POSIX Threads)  
✅ Networking with Sockets  

🔹 **Embedded Systems & Microcontrollers**  
✅ Basics of Embedded C  
✅ Working with Arduino & Raspberry Pi  
✅ Memory Management in Embedded Systems
